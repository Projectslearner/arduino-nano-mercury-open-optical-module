# Mercury Open Optical Module

#### Project Overview

The Mercury Open Optical Module project demonstrates how to use an Arduino Nano to interface with a mercury open optical module to detect obstructions. The mercury open optical module typically consists of an infrared emitter and receiver pair, capable of detecting the presence or absence of obstructions between them. This project provides a basic setup for reading digital values from the module and determining the obstruction status.

#### Components Needed
